                Step inside the next-generation Beechcraft King Air B200 and you
                are immediately steeped in a sense of awe. This is the aircraft
                that changed an industry and now stands alone as the most
                successful turbine-powered business aircraft model of all time.
                It earned this distinction by establishing and maintaining a
                tradition of engineering excellence and exceptional value. The
                King Air can often be cheaper for customers when compared to
                light jets on short routes. The aircraft does however fly very
                slightly slower. The King Air is a very versatile aircraft. It
                is used across the world by the military and also for medical
                excursion flights.
